        <h1>My beautiful little princess ❤️ </h1>
        <h2>
            I spent 3 years of my life loving you, caring for you, making sure you're smiling, laughing, happy, safe, warm, and always have someone to rant to.
            <br><br>
            I built a relationship with your sister, showed her that I REALLY love you, and that I will always make you happy no matter what you’re going through.
            <br><br>
            I have, and will always spoil you every time I get the chance, always go above and beyond just to see that precious lil smile on your precious lil face. 
            <br><br>
            So stop being a cute lil hoe and just BE MY VALENTINE 😂😂😂❤️❤️
