            Ok so I know youâ€™ve been wondering like why tf hasnâ€™t Zeeshan asked me to be his valentine yet, like is this mf joking or what cos he knows he's supposed to ask me every year ffs man ðŸ™„.<br><br>
            Donâ€™t worry baby, I KNOW I have to ask my baby every year and this year is no different - well, itâ€™s a little different ðŸ™‚.<br><br>
            I thought to myself, instead of writing a nice long handwritten love letter like last year, I did do a whole ass computer science A Level course in college and even tho I just about passed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I thought why not put it to use.<br><br>
            So I wanted to make a little website and ask you in a more creative way. Soooooo my lil baby girl, the question you have been waiting WEEKS for....
